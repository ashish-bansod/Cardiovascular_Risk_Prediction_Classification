        "The objective of this project was to utilize machine learning methods to predict the likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients over a span of 10 years. The project utilized data from an ongoing cardiovascular study conducted in Framingham, Massachusetts, which provided information on more than 4,000 patients and included 15 attributes representing potential risk factors for CHD. These factors encompassed demographics, behavior, and medical aspects.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure the data was suitable for analysis, extensive preprocessing was carried out. This involved addressing missing values using techniques such as median, mode, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation. Outliers were detected and eliminated using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Skewed continuous variables were transformed using  square root transformations to improve symmetry and enhance model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature selection was performed by assessing the variance inflation factor to identify and remove multicollinearity. Additionally, a new feature called pulse pressure was created to capture the relationship between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Redundant columns were eliminated to simplify the dataset. The most influential features for predicting CHD risk were identified as 'age,' 'sex', 'cigs_per_day,' 'bp_meds,' 'prevalent_stroke,' 'prevalent_hyp,' 'diabetes,' 'total_cholesterol,' 'bmi,' 'heart_rate,' 'glucose,' and 'pulse_pressure.'\n",
        "\n",
        "To address the imbalanced nature of the dataset, the SMOTE combined with Tomek links undersampling technique was employed to balance the class distribution and enhance model performance. The data was standardized using the standard scalar method to ensure that all features were on a comparable scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple machine learning models were evaluated based on their performance using recall as the primary evaluation metric. After thorough analysis, the Neural Network  was selected as the final prediction model due to its highest recall score among the models evaluated. Choosing a model with a high recall score aimed to accurately identify as many patients at risk of CHD as possible, even at the cost of some false positives.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this project showcased the potential of machine learning techniques in accurately predicting CHD risk in patients using data from a cardiovascular study. By meticulously preprocessing and transforming the data, selecting relevant features, and opting for an appropriate model based on its performance on a relevant evaluation metric, it was possible to make significant strides in accurately predicting CHD risk in patients, thus yielding a positive impact in the field."
